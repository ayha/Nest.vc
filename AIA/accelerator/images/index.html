      <div class="question">
        <p> Will AIA or Nest take equity from my company?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We do not take equity in the startup as part of the application of the programme. At the end of the 3 months supporting system and accelerator provided by Nest and AIA, we will arrange a pitch event to introduce the startup to the investment world. At this point Nest and / or AIA may also offer to invest in the startup.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>No. Some will, but the majority will be a network of entrepreneurs and business leaders throughout Hong Kong and many are listed on the Nest website <a href="http://www.nest.vc/team" target="_blank">www.nest.vc/team</a>.</p>

          <p>AIA and NEST are offering 3 months’ support for free, however there will be a warrant system in place allowing both AIA and NEST to potentially invest in a startup later. This also means that you'll be part of the extended NEST network and will always be able to benefit from the business opportunities this presents. click <a href="#">here to view the warrant arrangement</a>.

          <p>We recommend that you're on-site as much as possible during the programme. The more immersed in it you are, the more you'll gain. Although we appreciate you may need to occasionally work elsewhere, please be aware that participating companies won't be able to take any AIA information or data away.

          <p>Anyone from anywhere can apply. If you're accepted, you'll need to have a legal right to be in Hong Kong. Nest/AIA may be able to provide working visas for successful companies for the duration of the programme. If this isn't possible, we can put you in touch with agencies and services that can help you with visas and immigration, but we can only do this once you've been accepted onto the programme.</p>
